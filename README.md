# Scaling lidar-derived rainforest canopy metrics across a Mesoamerican landscape

This file is a guide to the code included in the Github repository.

There are three folders containing code: bat-files, SLURM, and code.

Within bat-files, you can find files used to process lidar data in the US Forest Service's FUSION program. This was used to calculate vertical diversity metrics and ultimately create the vertical diversity histograms shown in the manuscript.

Within the SLURM folder, you will find SLURM for running the Moran's I code in a supercomputer.

The code folder contains all of the lidar analyses done in R.
